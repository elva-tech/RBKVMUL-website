    "para1": "The development of the dairy sector in the region was formally initiated in 1989 with the establishment of the Raichur & Bellary Co-operative Milk Producers’ Societies Union Ltd. during 1989–90. The Union was formed to strengthen organized milk production and marketing by bringing rural milk producers under a structured co-operative framework. From its inception, the Union aimed to create a sustainable system that would benefit farmers economically while ensuring a steady supply of quality milk to consumers.",

    "para2": "The operational jurisdiction of the Union initially extended across the entire Raichur District, covering four talukas, and the Bellary District, comprising seven talukas. By organizing village-level milk producers into co-operative societies, the Union enabled farmers to collectively market their milk, access veterinary and technical services, and receive fair and timely payments. This approach significantly reduced exploitation by middlemen and improved income stability for rural households.",

    "para3": "The Union adopted the AMUL co-operative model, which emphasizes farmer ownership, democratic management, and transparent operations. Dairying was promoted as a major subsidiary occupation, particularly for small and marginal farmers, with the objective of achieving socio-economic upliftment in rural areas. Through this model, the Union not only enhanced milk production and productivity but also contributed to employment generation and improved livelihoods.",

    "para4": "Subsequently, the Union expanded its operational area by including Koppal District, leading to its reconstitution as the Raichur, Bellary & Koppal Co-operative Milk Producers’ Societies Union Ltd. This expansion strengthened the regional dairy network and reinforced the Union’s role in rural development, making dairying a reliable and sustainable source of income for farmers across the three districts."

"title": "Artificial Insemination Emergency activites",
"intro": "The artificial insemination (AI) process in dairy involves collecting bull semen, processing/freezing it in straws, and then a skilled technician manually depositing it into a cow's uterus using an \"AI gun\" and rectal palpation to pinpoint the cervix at the right time (heat/estrus) for fertilization, improving genetics and production without natural mating. Key steps include detecting heat, preparing the semen (thawing a frozen straw), inserting a lubricated arm into the rectum to guide the gun, passing the gun through the cervix, and depositing semen in the uterine body for conception.",
"semenTitle": "Semen Collection & Processing (At AI Center)",
"semenPoints": [
"Semen is collected from genetically superior bulls.",
"Mixed with extenders (milk, sugars, antibiotics) for nutrition and protection, then diluted.",
"Placed in small plastic straws, frozen in liquid nitrogen at -196°C, and stored."
]

"fodder": {
"title": "Fodder Activity",
"intro": "Fodder production in the dairy industry involves planning, cultivating specific crops (like maize, sorghum, legumes), or using modern techniques like hydroponics/sprouting for year-round green fodder, conserving surplus as silage/hay, processing crop residues into fortified blocks, and ensuring consistent quality for optimal animal nutrition, which all boost milk yield and farm sustainability. The process balances field growing, conservation (hay/silage), and innovative indoor methods to meet dairy herd nutritional needs.",
"traditionalTitle": "Traditional & Field-Based Fodder Production",
"traditionalPoints": [
"Assess herd needs, available land, water, and climate to select suitable fodder crops (e.g., maize, sorghum, oats, like Desmanthus).",
"Prepare land, sow seeds (often with fertilizers), irrigate (or rely on rain), and manage pests.",
"Cut crops at optimal growth stages (e.g., maize at milk-dough stage) for maximum nutrients, using mowers and binders."
],
"conservationTitle": "Conservation(Silage/Hay)",
"conservationPoints": [
"Ferment chopped green fodder (maize, sorghum) in airtight silos to preserve nutrients.",
"Dry cut fodder (grasses, legumes) in the sun, then bale it for storage."

"stepPoints": [
"Support to Training and Employment Programme for Women (STEP): Funded by the Ministry of Women & Child Development, this program provides financial and technical assistance to implement agencies (like dairy cooperatives and NGOs) to organize women into dairy cooperative societies (WDCS). Training and employment opportunities are provided, including access to credit for purchasing livestock.",
"National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD): Implemented by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, this scheme provides financial assistance for training dairy farmers (including women) and staff of dairy cooperative societies on clean milk production, animal health, nutrition, and good management practices.",
"NABARD Initiatives: The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) supports skill and entrepreneurship training for women through Micro Enterprise Development Programmes (MEDPs) and Livelihood and Enterprise Development Programmes (LEDPs), often delivered through SHGs. NABARD also provides concessional refinance to banks for loans given to women's SHGs."

"processingTitle": "Processing and Production Activity",
"processingDesc": "Dairy processing turns raw milk into safe, consumable products through steps like collection, testing, filtration, pasteurization (heating to kill germs), homogenization (breaking fat for smoothness), standardization (adjusting fat), and product-specific steps (fermentation for yogurt, churning for butter), followed by packaging and distribution to ensure quality and shelf-life.",
"coreSteps": [
"Milk arrives from farms, is tested for quality, safety, and composition (fat/protein), then cooled and stored.",
"Removes physical impurities and sediment.",
"Centrifugal force separates milk into cream (high fat) and skim milk (low fat).",
"Fat content is adjusted by blending cream and skim milk for consistent product quality (e.g., whole, low-fat milk).",
"Heating milk to specific temperatures to destroy pathogens and extend shelf life.",
"Breaks down fat globules under high pressure to prevent cream from rising, ensuring a uniform texture."
],
"productSteps": [
"Involves adding bacterial cultures for fermentation and coagulation.",
"Cream is churned to separate butterfat from buttermilk.",
"Milk is concentrated in evaporators and spray-dried.",
"Milk and products are filled into hygienic containers (cartons, bottles) to protect them from light, air, and recontamination.",
"Chilled storage and refrigerated transport ensure freshness until it reaches consumers."
